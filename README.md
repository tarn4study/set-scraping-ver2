# set-scraping-ver2
This is an upgrade version of the first one.
It's doing the same job which is scraping from SET website. However, this can scrape multiple of page which can be adjust by choosing a group of industry.
In contrast to the first version, you can't choose website manually. The result are in excel files and in Thai.
Ps. I use pipenv for this so there is a pipfile that contains the requirement.
